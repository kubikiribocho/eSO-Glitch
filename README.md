## Undaunted Coffer Glitch

Undaunted chest system bugged/broken, bought 7 undaunted coffers in the new system, look what shoulder this one had inside.

Undaunted system broken! Waste of keys and my time, btw I also bought 4 City of Ash Coffers and only got 4 Infernal Guardian shoulders, no Valkyn Skoria >:-(.

 Out of 25 keys, 5 tries, all infernal guardian sets, and some of these chest also give Ornate axes and swords with no shoulders of any set. There is luck, there is probability, there's psuedo random chance, and then there's constants. Untill this bug is fixed I'll check every weekend golden merchant sale, till this is fixed I wont spend anymore money on crowns.
